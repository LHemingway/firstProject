Call of Java!
================

Read me for call of java, my first project for Sparta Global during SDET training.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to impliment the skills that have been learnt during the first two weeks of training on the Sparta Gloabl SDET training course.

As well as demonstrating the recently learned web development skills that are present in the application. I have also put into practise using BASH/Terminal to navigate through folders and to make regular commits to GitHub.

## Functionality

It is a simple browser based game. When the game begins after the user has entered their name, paratroopers will start at the left hand side of the screen, swing to the right and back to the left before disappearing.

In this time the users aim is to click on the paratrooper to score points and remove it from the screen. Failing to do so will result in the user losing a life of which they start with 3. After all 3 lives are lost the game will end and the user will be given the option to play again. 

## Implementation

The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* HTML5
* Semantic HTML5
* CSS
* CSS Bootstrap
* semantic HTML5
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Sublime
* Responsive web development/design (no separate m-dot site)
* http://www.picresize.com/

## Usage

### Building

What I did how and when... Kinda what I'll be saying in the prezz

During the projects lifecycle 

### Running

Set up local web servers to point to `dist/dev` and `dist/prod` for _dev_ and _prod_ distributions, respectively.
